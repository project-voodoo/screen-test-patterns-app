Screen Test Pattern Android Application:

by François SIMOND aka supercurio

This app display simple colors on your Android device screen.
Those colors are then measured by a colorimeter or spectrophotometer
in order to build graphs or color profiles.

I recommend using free software Color HCFR:

but I guess alternative solutions like Calman or ChromaPure are fine.

Current version hosts only a tablet layout.

Requirements:
- A computer
- A colorimeter or spectrophotometer
